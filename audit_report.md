# Audit Report: Integration of SECURITY.md

**Date:** 2025-10-09
**Auditor:** Jules

## 1. Introduction

This report documents the audit of the recent pull request that introduced the `SECURITY.md` file into the repository. The purpose of this audit was to verify that the changes were implemented correctly, follow established project protocols, and are properly integrated into the existing build system.

## 2. Summary of Findings

The audit confirms that the integration of `SECURITY.md` was executed successfully and adheres to the project's development principles. The implementation is modular, clean, and correctly integrated into the build process.

Key findings are as follows:

*   **New `SECURITY.md` file:** A new `SECURITY.md` file has been added to the repository root. This file serves as a dedicated, human-readable document outlining the project's security protocols.
*   **Programmatic Generation:** The `SECURITY.md` file is programmatically generated, which aligns with the project's principle of maintaining single sources of truth. The file header correctly indicates that it is a build artifact and should not be edited directly.
*   **New `protocols/security/` Directory:** The source files for `SECURITY.md` are located in a new, dedicated `protocols/security/` directory. This isolates security-related protocols from the general agent protocols, creating a clear and logical separation of concerns.
*   **Unmodified Compiler:** The core `tooling/protocol_compiler.py` script was not modified. This demonstrates a sound architectural choice, as the existing tool was flexible enough to be reused for a new purpose without modification.
*   **`Makefile` Integration:** The `Makefile` was updated to orchestrate the generation of `SECURITY.md`.
    *   A new `compile-security-protocols` target was added to handle the specific compilation of the security protocols.
    *   This new target is correctly invoked by the main `build` target, ensuring that `SECURITY.md` is generated alongside `AGENTS.md` and other project artifacts as part of the standard build process.

## 3. Conclusion

The introduction of the `SECURITY.md` file and its associated build process is a well-executed enhancement to the project. The changes are robust, maintainable, and fully integrated. No conflicts or protocol violations were identified during this audit.

The audit is complete. No further action is required.
