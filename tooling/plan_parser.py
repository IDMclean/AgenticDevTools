"""
Parses a plan file into a structured list of commands.

This module provides the `parse_plan` function and the `Command` dataclass,
which are central to the agent's ability to understand and execute plans.
The parser correctly handles multi-line arguments and ignores comments,
allowing for robust and readable plan files.
