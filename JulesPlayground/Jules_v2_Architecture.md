# Jules v2: An Architecture for a Paraconsistent Agent

## 1. Introduction

This document proposes a new architecture for an agent, "Jules v2," that is capable of reasoning with inconsistency and undeterminedness. This architecture is a departure from the classical agent architecture, which is based on a single, consistent world model. The Jules v2 architecture, by contrast, is based on a "Belief State" model that can represent a set of beliefs about the world, which may be inconsistent or incomplete.

## 2. The Four Pillars of the Jules v2 Architecture

The Jules v2 architecture is based on four key components:

1.  **A Formal Substrate for Reasoning:** The agent's reasoning is based on a non-classical logic, Paradefinite Light Linear Logic (PLLL), as defined in the `paraconsistent_logic.md` document. This logic provides a formal, mathematical way to reason about resources and state changes, and it is essential for creating an agent that can handle inconsistency and undeterminedness.
2.  **A "Belief State" Model:** The agent's state is represented by a "Belief State," as defined in the `belief_state.md` document. The Belief State is a set of beliefs about facts, where each belief can be `TRUE`, `FALSE`, `INCONSISTENT`, or `UNDETERMINED`.
3.  **A "Semantic" Interpreter:** The agent's behavior is driven by a "Semantic" Interpreter, as defined in the `semantic_interpreter.md` document. The Semantic Interpreter is an interpreter for the APPL language that updates the agent's Belief State in response to contradictions, rather than halting with an error.
4.  **A Meta-Cognitive Loop:** The agent's top-level control loop is a "meta-cognitive" loop that allows the agent to reason about its own problem-solving process. When the agent encounters a problem that it cannot solve with its current knowledge, it enters a "ProblemSolving" state, where it can use its knowledge base to form a hypothesis about the nature of the problem and to propose a solution.

## 3. The Jules v2 Agent in Action

The Jules v2 agent is designed to be a "scientist" agent that can explore and understand complex and uncertain domains. The agent's top-level control loop is as follows:

1.  **Observe:** The agent observes its environment and updates its Belief State.
2.  **Hypothesize:** The agent uses its knowledge base to form a hypothesis about the nature of the environment.
3.  **Experiment:** The agent designs and executes an experiment to test its hypothesis.
4.  **Learn:** The agent updates its knowledge base based on the results of the experiment.

This control loop allows the agent to learn and adapt its behavior over time, and it is the key to creating an agent that can survive and thrive in the paradoxical world of the `SynthPlayground`.

## 4. Conclusion

The Jules v2 architecture is a powerful and flexible architecture for building agents that can reason with inconsistency and undeterminedness. It is a significant step forward in the development of artificial intelligence, and it is the key to unlocking the full potential of the `SynthPlayground`.
