# Post-Mortem Report

**Task ID:** `fix/atomic-fsm-workflow`
**Completion Date:** `2025-10-07`

## 1. Task Summary

The objective of this task was to rectify a critical atomicity flaw in the FSM workflow. The previous implementation finalized the task *before* generating the post-mortem report, meaning the analysis was never included in the final submission. This was a direct violation of the protocol's intent.

The task was successful. I re-architected the FSM by introducing a new `AWAITING_ANALYSIS` state and an interactive analysis phase. The system now enforces a workflow where a draft post-mortem is created, paused for interactive analysis, and then finalized *before* the FSM enters its terminal `AWAITING_SUBMISSION` state. This guarantees that all task artifacts, including the detailed analysis, are present and correct before the final commit.

## 2. Process Analysis

### What Went Well
*   **Root Cause Identification:** I was able to correctly diagnose the core issue from the user's feedback: the problem wasn't just about file creation, but about the *timing* of that creation and the lack of a genuine analysis step.
*   **Test-Driven Correction:** The iterative test failures were instrumental in refining the solution. The validator rejecting incomplete plans and the FSM failing on incorrect state transitions were not setbacks, but successful uses of the protocol to enforce its own correctness. Each failure revealed a deeper requirement of the system.
*   **Architectural Solution:** Instead of a superficial patch, the solution was a fundamental re-architecture of the FSM lifecycle. Introducing the `AWAITING_ANALYSIS` state is a robust, long-term fix that addresses the root cause.

### What Could Be Improved
*   **Initial Implementation Blindness:** My initial implementations of the FSM were naive. I focused on making the states transition correctly without fully considering the *semantic meaning* of each state or the overarching goal of task atomicity. I treated "post-mortem" as "create a file" instead of "perform an analysis".
*   **Reactive vs. Proactive Correction:** I did not identify this critical atomicity flaw myself. It required direct user feedback to point it out. My self-correction capabilities need to improve to catch such logical and architectural errors proactively.

### Root Cause Analysis
The root cause of the initial failure was a cognitive error similar to previous tasks, but with a new dimension. I was treating the protocol as a checklist of actions to be automated, rather than a workflow of states with distinct purposes. The "Post-Mortem" state triggered an action, but I failed to implement a mechanism to ensure the *quality* and *timing* of that action's inputs (the analysis) and outputs (the report). The user's feedback forced me to design a system that enforces not just the *execution* of a step, but the *conditions necessary* for that step to be meaningful.

## 3. Corrective Actions & Lessons Learned

1.  **Lesson:** A protocol's state must represent a meaningful condition of the system, not just a point in a script.
    **Action:** When designing or modifying FSMs, I will first define the *purpose* and *requirements* of each state (e.g., "Awaiting Analysis" means a draft file exists and I am actively analyzing it). The implementation will then be built to enforce those requirements.

2.  **Lesson:** Interactive, cognitive steps require dedicated states and explicit signals.
    **Action:** For any future task requiring my own analysis or input, I will explicitly model it in the FSM with a dedicated "AWAITING_AGENT" state and a corresponding signal file (e.g., `_complete.txt`). This makes the handoff between automated execution and my cognitive work clear and testable.

3.  **Lesson:** Test-driven development is the most effective way to validate complex, multi-state workflows.
    **Action:** I will continue to prioritize the creation of comprehensive, end-to-end integration tests for any FSM or protocol change. The iterative process of fixing the test plan and the implementation in this task was proof of its value.
