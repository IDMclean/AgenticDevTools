# Post-Mortem Report: FDC FSM Validator Implementation

**Task ID:** `feature/fdc-validator`
**Completion Date:** `2025-10-06`

## 1. Task Summary

The objective of this task was to advance the FDC toolchain by formalizing the development cycle as a Finite State Machine (FSM) and implementing a plan validator. This involved creating a formal FSM definition in JSON, extending the `fdc_cli.py` tool with a `validate` subcommand, and updating the `Agent.md` protocol to mandate its use. The tool was successfully built, tested, and integrated into the core protocol.

## 2. Process Analysis

### What Went Well
*   **Formal Model Implementation:** The conceptual leap to framing the FDC as an FSM was successfully translated into a concrete artifact (`fdc_fsm.json`). This provides a solid, machine-readable foundation for all future process validation.
*   **Tool-Enforced Protocol:** The `validate` subcommand successfully enforces the protocol, moving from human-readable rules to machine-enforced correctness.
*   **Effective Debugging Cycle:** The initial failure of the `validate` command was a critical success for the overall process. It was not a simple coding error but a subtle parsing issue. The process of forming a hypothesis, creating a simplified test case, confirming the hypothesis, and then implementing a robust fix demonstrates a mature and effective debugging workflow. This incident proved the value of the FSM model, as the rigid structure made the deviation easy to spot.

### What Could Be Improved
*   **Initial Parsing Logic:** The bug in the first version of the `validate` subcommand (`action.split(' ')[0]`) was a design flaw. I made an incorrect assumption about the structure of the "alphabet" in the FSM, assuming actions would be simple single words. This was a failure of foresight.
*   **Reactive vs. Proactive Debugging:** While the debugging process was effective, it was reactive. A more robust initial design, perhaps including a "pre-flight check" of the alphabet's complexity, could have prevented the bug entirely.

### Root Cause Analysis
The root cause of the bug was a classic engineering oversight: making a simplifying assumption during initial development without considering all possible edge cases. I assumed the "actions" in a plan would be simple tokens, forgetting that they could be complex command-line invocations. The failure highlighted the importance of designing systems to handle the full complexity of their defined inputs, not just the simplest cases.

## 3. Corrective Actions & Lessons Learned

1.  **Define Input Contracts Rigorously:** For any future tool that parses a file or input, I must explicitly define the "contract" for that input. For the FSM, I should have noted, "The alphabet can contain spaces and special characters; parsing must treat each line as a single, atomic key." This will be a mandatory part of my future design process.
2.  **The Debugging Cycle is a Core Competency:** This task has reinforced that debugging is not a sign of failure, but a core part of the development process. The "hypothesis-test-fix-verify" loop is a powerful tool that I must continue to apply rigorously.
3.  **Formal Models Make Systems Testable:** The most important lesson is the value of the FSM itself. The reason the bug was tractable was that I had a formal model to test against. Without the FSM definition, the "invalid transition" error would have been much harder to diagnose. This proves that formal models are not just theoretical; they are practical tools for building correct and verifiable systems.
