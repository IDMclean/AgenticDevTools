## 1. Task Summary

The objective of this task was to close the protocol's learning loop by automating the extraction of lessons from post-mortem reports and compiling them into the central `knowledge_core/lessons_learned.md` file. The previous system required manual transcription, which was a significant gap in the self-improvement process.

The task was a success. I designed and implemented a new tool, `tooling/knowledge_compiler.py`, which uses regular expressions to parse finalized post-mortem reports. I then integrated this tool into the FSM's `do_post_mortem` state, ensuring it is automatically run after every task. The entire new workflow was validated with a new unit test and a major expansion of the existing integration test suite.

## 2. Process Analysis

### What Went Well
*   **Structured Planning:** The plan to first build the tool, then integrate it, then test it, was logical and effective.
*   **Unit Testing First:** Creating a dedicated unit test for the `knowledge_compiler.py` script was highly effective. It immediately caught a subtle regex bug in a controlled environment, which was much easier to debug than if it had been discovered only through the full integration test.
*   **Iterative Test Correction:** The process of debugging the integration test, while it had failures, ultimately produced a very robust and comprehensive validation of the entire, complex, end-to-end workflow.

### What Could Be Improved
*   **Regex Implementation Error:** The initial implementation of the lesson-parsing regex was flawed (it was too greedy), causing the unit test to fail. This is a recurring theme that suggests I need to be more meticulous when implementing detailed parsing logic.
*   **Test Simulation Flaw:** My first attempt at updating the integration test failed because I simulated the "analysis" step by appending a new section to the draft file, rather than editing it. This created a malformed report. This highlights a need to more accurately model my own real-world actions when designing tests.

### Root Cause Analysis
The root cause of the failures during this task was a lack of precision in implementation and testing. The regex bug was a simple mistake. The flawed test simulation was a more significant cognitive error where I failed to consider the exact state of the artifact being modified. In both cases, the test suite performed its function perfectly by catching these errors before they could be integrated into the main branch. The process worked as intended.

## 3. Corrective Actions & Lessons Learned

1.  **Lesson:** For any new, independent component with clear inputs and outputs (like a parser), a dedicated unit test should always be created and validated *before* integrating it into a larger, more complex workflow.
    **Action:** My plans for creating new tools will now always include two distinct, sequential steps: 1) Implement the tool and its dedicated unit test. 2) Integrate the validated tool into the main system.

2.  **Lesson:** Test simulations of my own interactive steps must be as faithful as possible to the real action.
    **Action:** When writing integration tests that simulate my cognitive input (like analyzing a file), I will ensure the test modifies the file in the same way I would (e.g., editing/overwriting a draft, not just appending to it).
