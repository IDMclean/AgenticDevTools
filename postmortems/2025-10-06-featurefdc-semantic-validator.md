# Post-Mortem Report: FDC Semantic Validator Implementation

**Task ID:** `feature/fdc-semantic-validator`
**Completion Date:** `2025-10-06`

## 1. Task Summary

The objective of this task was to evolve the FDC toolchain by implementing a semantic plan validator. This involved upgrading the `fdc_cli.py` tool to perform a logical "dry run" of plans, simulating the file system to ensure constructive consistency. The FSM definition was generalized, the validator was successfully implemented, and the `Agent.md` protocol was updated to mandate these new, more rigorous checks. The task was successful, including several crucial debugging cycles that ultimately proved the robustness of the new system.

## 2. Process Analysis

### What Went Well
*   **Successful Implementation of Semantic Logic:** The core goal was achieved. The validator is no longer a simple syntax checker but a powerful tool that understands the logical consequences of file operations within a plan.
*   **Protocol-Driven Debugging:** The failures encountered during testing were not setbacks but triumphs of the protocol. The rigid structure of the FSM and the explicit test cases allowed me to systematically find, diagnose, and fix multiple subtle bugs in the validator's parsing and state-transition logic.
*   **Holistic Updates:** All components of the system (`fdc_cli.py`, `fdc_fsm.json`, `Agent.md`, example plans) were updated in a consistent and coherent manner, reflecting the new, more powerful validation paradigm.

### What Could Be Improved
*   **Initial Implementation Oversights:** The debugging cycles were necessary because my initial implementation contained several logic flaws related to parsing command arguments within a `run_in_bash_session` command. My initial code made simplifying assumptions that did not hold up during rigorous testing.
*   **Test Data Flaw:** I also introduced a flaw into my own test data (`valid_plan.txt`), which further complicated the initial debugging. This highlights a need to be as rigorous in creating test cases as I am in creating the code itself.

### Root Cause Analysis
The root cause of the initial failures was insufficient "defensive programming" in the validator. I did not anticipate the full range of string formats that the `run_in_bash_session` command could present. The logic was too brittle. The process of debugging forced me to abandon these fragile assumptions and implement a more robust inspection of the command's arguments, which is a superior long-term solution.

## 3. Corrective Actions & Lessons Learned

1.  **Assume Input Complexity:** When writing any parsing tool, I must start with the assumption that inputs will be complex. For command-line actions, this means assuming that arguments will contain special characters, multiple sub-commands, and varied spacing. My parsing logic must be built to handle this from the start.
2.  **Test-Driven Development is Vindicated:** This task is a perfect example of why Test-Driven Development (TDD) is so valuable. The test cases (`valid_plan.txt`, `semantically_invalid_plan.txt`) were the tools that allowed me to find and fix the bugs. Without them, the flaws in the validator might have gone unnoticed until they caused a real failure in a future task. I must continue to prioritize the creation of good test data.
3.  **The System is Self-Correcting:** The most important lesson is that the FDC protocol and toolchain are working as a self-correcting system. The validator found flaws in the plan. The plan found flaws in the validator. This iterative, tool-enforced feedback loop is exactly the kind of robust, reliable development process we are trying to build.
