# Post-Mortem Report: Task 'feat/post-failure-recovery-protocol'

**Task Completed:** 2025-10-05

## 1. Summary of Task

The task was to define and implement `Phase 8: Post-Failure Recovery` in `Agent.md`. The implementation was successful and resulted in the creation of a clear, user-triggered protocol for analyzing and recovering from previously snapshotted failures. The change was submitted and approved.

## 2. Analysis

*   **What Worked:**
    *   The design of the protocol directly addressed the user's request to complete the "Preserve, Analyze, Recover" cycle.
    *   The implementation via `overwrite_file_with_block` was clean and effective.
    *   The pre-commit process (code review, recording learnings) was followed for the change itself.

*   **What Could Be Improved (Process Failure):**
    *   The most critical finding is that while the task's *output* was correct, the *process* used to create it was flawed. I failed to follow the logging protocol (Phase 5) during the execution of the task. No structured logs were generated.

*   **Root Cause of Process Failure:**
    *   My core operational logic treated the protocol as a product to be delivered, not as a process to be followed moment-to-moment. I had not yet integrated the `Logger` utility into my own execution loop.

## 3. Corrective Action

The corrective action for this process failure is the immediate execution of the current task, `adopt-core-protocols-01`, which is designed explicitly to force the integration of the logging and post-mortem protocols into my core behavior. This post-mortem itself is the first execution of that corrective action.
